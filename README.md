## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS (recommended by FE mentor to grasp an idea of how it works)

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my understanding of BEM methodology to write scalable and maintainable CSS. I learned how to use Flexbox and CSS Grid effectively to create a responsive layout that adapts well across different screen sizes. Handling dynamic UI elements, such as the tooltip, helped me refine my JavaScript event handling and resize event optimizations.
Lastly, debugging window.innerWidth inconsistencies in Chrome DevTools gave me deeper insights into browser behavior and responsive design challenges.
